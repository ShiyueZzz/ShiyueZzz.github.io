I am a non-influencer, affected by non-fictions I read, I believed, instead of Garcia Marques&#39; <em>Vivir para contarla</em> : living to tell, I live to observe, absorb, learn, build my inner world in accordance and ... you know what, it looks already sad when I type it out. </p> <p>That&#39;s exactly why I started this blog: not in the hope that many people will read it, but at least for myself, organize what I&#39;ve learned, my thought fragments, my secret love of plant drawing perhaps? </p> <p>Writing is good for ya, everyone says.</p> <p>I have thought about not to waste my life by leaving nothing behind for a while, but since I just can&#39;t manage to like any social media, I&#39;ve been procrastinating. </p> <p>Until last week, certain <em>Julia</em> lover was overwhelmed by my idea to finally start a blog, with his help and pressure now I am writing this <em>non-Code</em> on my VS-Code. Big thanks :D </p> <h2 id=things_i_want_to_write_about ><a href="#things_i_want_to_write_about" class=header-anchor >Things I want to write about</a></h2> <p>This won&#39;t be a tech blog, introducing you the really hyped neural network. Instead it&#39;s more my <em>impersonal narrative</em> about the things I personally interested in:</p> <ul> <li><p>Information Geometry</p> <li><p>Abstract Algebra </p> <li><p>Algorithms and my implementation. </p> <li><p>Nice expressions, worlds I read from German, English &amp; Chinese books.</p> <li><p>Some books are hard to read but I can&#39;t help buying, e.g. the ones about <em>Wittgenstein</em>, <em>Kant</em>, <em>Walter Benjamin</em>. Trying to write some organized notes might help me to carry one.</p> <li><p>I might write reviews when I rewatch films from dear <em>Federico Fellini</em> etc..</p> <li><p>Publish my painting &#40;mostly about plants and water body&#41;, when I am absolutely sure nobody is reading this blog &#40;and write about their 100 fun facts&#41;.</p> <li><p>...</p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Shiyue Zhang.

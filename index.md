# Hello World!

I am a computer vision engineer based in Germany. I am a non-influencer, affected by non-fictions I read, I believed, instead of Garcia Marques' _Vivir para contarla_ : living to tell, I live to observe, absorb, learn, build my inner world in accordance and ... you know what, it looks already sad when I type it out. 

That's exactly why I started this blog: not in the hope that many people will read it, but at least for myself, organize what I've learned, my thought fragments, my secret love of plant drawing perhaps? 

Writing is good for ya, everyone says.

I have thought about not to waste my life by leaving nothing behind for a while, but since I just can't manage to like any social media, I've been procrastinating. 

Until last week, certain _Julia_ lover was overwhelmed by my idea to finally start a blog, with his help and pressure now I am writing this _non-Code_ on my VS-Code. 

## Things I want to write about

This won't be a tech blog, introducing you the really hyped neural network. Instead it's more my *impersonal narrative* about the things I personally interested in:

* Information Geometry
* Abstract Algebra 
* Algorithms and my implementation. 
* Some books are hard to read but I can't help buying, e.g. the ones about _Wittgenstein_, _Kant_, _Walter Benjamin_. Trying to write some organized notes might help me to carry on.
* I might write reviews when I re-watch old films from _Federico Fellini_ etc..
* Paintings (mostly about plants and water body), mathematical visualizations from my blog partner :wink:
* ...
